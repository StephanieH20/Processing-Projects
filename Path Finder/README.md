From 2018. Product of my boredom while on a 15-hour bus ride from Boston to Detroit. I was playing around with breadth-first search and discovered how the algorithm could be used to find the shortest path between two points. I was pretty excited by this and threw together a little demonstration. The BFS Shortest Path Algorithm is well known and something that's usually taught in a college Algorithms class, but I was pretty excited to have stumbled upon it myself.

First draw the maze. When you're done, press space and select the start and end points. The search automatically begins after doing so.
