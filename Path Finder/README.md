From 2018. I was bored on a 15-hour bus ride from Boston to Detroit and discovered that breadth-first search could be used to find the shortest path between two points. I was pretty excited by this and threw together a little demonstration. 

First draw the maze. When you're done, press space and select the start and end points. The search automatically begins after doing so.
