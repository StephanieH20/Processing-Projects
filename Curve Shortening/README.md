From 2022, after hearing about Grigori Perelman's infamous solution to the Poincare Conjecture. His proof used something called Ricci Flow. This project provides a simple illustration in 2D. The algorithm essentially "smooths" out a closed curve, shrinking it down into a circle and then a point. 

Draw a closed curve then press space to start curve shortening.
