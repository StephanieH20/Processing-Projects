From 2022, after hearing about Grigori Perelman's infamous solution to the Poincare Conjecture. His proof used something called Ricci Flow. This project provides a simple illustration in 2D, in which this could simply be referred to as curve-shortening flow: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve-shortening_flow#
The algorithm essentially "smooths" out a closed curve by incrementally minimizing curvature around the curve, shrinking it down into a circle and then a point. 

Draw a closed curve then press space to start curve shortening.
